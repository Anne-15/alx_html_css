            <h1>ALX Intro</h1>
            <p>My journey is like a hike. Many ups and downs along the way but there is hope at the end of the tunnel.
                It is not certain where we are going to end up in but there is hope
            </p>
            <h2>The unknown valley</h2>
            <p>Through out the journey, there are beautiful features being seen from a far and one wonders, when is it going to be
                my turn.
                It looks all roses and violets but for other people to enjoy.
            </p>
            <p>The question still remains, when is it ever going to be me up there enjoying the beautiful scenaries</p>
            <h3>The destination</h3>
            <p>Is it really my journey?</p>
            <p>I reminise about the process and the end goal but is that what I really want.</p>
            <p>Maybe am destined for other greatness but how will I know that.
                I know my interests and passion but getting there feeks so close yet so far.
                Questions come about what is the next step for you?
                Are you applying for masters studies abroad?
                What are your plans for the future?
            </p>
            <p>It is overwhelming to say the least but not because I don't have a plan but because I have a plan
                Am scared that the plan will not come to life and people will hold me accountable for it and label me for what is.
                I don't want that.
                I want people to trust my process without having to ask what the next step is cause things change and I may not know
                what next
                and that can label me as if I don't have my things figured out.
